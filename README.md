Learning to play Pong with Keras
================================

This repo has implementations of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in Keras to learn to play Atari Pong.

- `pong-pg.py` - Policy gradient (REINFORCE algorithm).
- `pong-actor-critic.py` - On-policy batch actor-critic. [Defeats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs2B6gPP49k) the opponent after 300 episodes of training.

Requirements
